#Setup and Installation 

Decided to use symfony 3.4 to take advantage of autowiring and dependency injection.
Though I know latest versions is 4.2 I have recent experience in 3.4 so in essence of time saving using it.
As mentioned in Controller, I have created a route localhost:8000/report/{merchantid} 
as I could not get on with using namespaces to work outside the framework.

* run composer update

# Project location

The main code is in the src/TransactionBundle

# running tests 

Tests can be run with command './vendor/bin/phpunit' in commandline
